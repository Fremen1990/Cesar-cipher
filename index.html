          In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the
          shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest
          and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of
          substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced
          by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For
          example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would
          become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used
          it in his private correspondence.[1]
